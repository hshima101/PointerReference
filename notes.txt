#Reference vs Pointers
Reference 
* Always needs an initializer
* Initializers should be I-value
* cannot be nullptr
* bound to its referent
* no storage required, so has same address as that of referent
* Dereference not required
* Using references will make permanent changes to values (Swap in the function will reflect in the global scope)

Pointer
* Initializer is optional
* Initializer does not need to be I-value
* Can be nullptr
* Can point to other variables 
* Has its own storage so has its own address
* Requires dereference operator to access the value
